Questions for Micah - Project Three - Team CharTindIan "SNPPR"
Tuesday, September 30


**Pitch:** 
By reducing the amount of steps needed to copy-and-paste images and links, SNPPR makes it quicker and more intuitive for people to share images with their contacts.

SNPPR is a web application that gives users a simple interface to  translate image and web links onto one page for easy access and easy sharing with contacts.



**Tell us what your API is (can change later if needed, but needs to have an idea that makes sense):** 
The SNPPR API takes user-submitted links to images and web sites and outputs these assets onto one web page, with a custom shortened URL, for quick and easy sharing.  The API will process the link and image information on the input page, post the assets to appear on a single output page via JSON and deliver a unique URL where the page can be permanently accessed.


When logged in, users can access previous entries and incorporate images saved on local machines.



**Is your team choosing roles, or pairing for everything?** 
- Based on experience and interest, we slotted out responsibilities such that Ian is the lead Ruby on Rails engineer; Satinder is the main JavaScript engineer and Charles will support both efforts and manage PivotalTracker and take on any tasks that need attention.

All team members will provide QA support throughout development.



**What concerns do you guys have right now?** 
Incorporating additional functionality that was outside of our original scope at the pitch presentation:
- Drag and Drop functionality
- Adding the ability for users to upload their personal images for inclusion into the service/site
- Scraping web sites for metadata to use in displaying web links

In addition, the overall process of development is always going to be an area of concern.



**Which lessons do you wish we had more review/time for?**
- Continued repetition of Ruby exercises, especially creating apps from scratch, and all examples of best practices are always welcome.
